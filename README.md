# DV2599-ML
Assignments in the Machine Learning course DV2599, autumn 2022

## Assignment 1
The aim of Assignment 1 was to implement a concept learner using email data and to verify that the model worked as expected with test data and a confusion matrix

## Assignment 2
The aim of Assignment 2 was to experimentally compare the computational and predictive performances of three different learning algorithms on a spam detection task

## Final Project
The aim of the final project was to explore and report on the application of machine learning to a real-world challenge. We chose to create an outlier detection model using DBSCAN. The data for the project was credit card transactions and our model attempted to detect the fraudulent ones with the best possible performance.

>Reports were also written for each assignment
